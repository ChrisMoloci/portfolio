                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Christian! You can also call me Chris if you'd like. I am 19 years old and am an
                    aspiring web developer. I am currently studying at St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario, and am set
                    to graduate in 2026. feel free to wander around my website for as long as you'd like and learn more
                    about me.

                <h2>What Matters Most</h1>
                <p>
                    Everyone's life is driven by something. It's what allows them to get up in the morning, it's what
                    gives them hope when they feel like giving up, it's what gives them their identity. To some this
                    motivator might be money, to others success, for others it may be fame, and to others it might be
                    love or approval. For me, however, I choose not to identify with any of these, rather, my life is
                    simply lived for Christ. Money can fade, success can turn into failure overnight, fame can is really
                    worse than it seems, and love, well, it can also be lost in the blink of an eye. While not all of
                    these things are bad to desire, and some are in fact, designed by God, the most solid foundation one
                    can choose to base their life on is Christ himself.

                <h2>Coding Background</h1>
                <p>
                    My coding background goes way back. My first experience with code was at the age of 13 years old,
                    that's when I first picked up web development after a family friend suggested I give it a try since
                    it seemed like a path that intrigued me. His hunch ended up paying off, and it turned out that I
                    really enjoyed it. However, I didn't really stick with it too much after the first year as life got
                    busy, but one day in grade 10, I got a new opportunity to pursue coding again, and I ended up taking
                    both an Introduction to Programming class which taught the basics of Python programming and an Intro
                    to Computer Science class. I then went on to take many more programming classes throughout high
                    school and even dabbled a bit in robotics.

                <h2>Tough Decisions</h1>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of grade 12, I received word that a robotics company was looking for some apprentices
                    to work for them. Since it seemed like a great opportunity with great money and even free schooling,
                    I ended up taking the opportunity and apprenticing as a Machinist/Millwrite, long story short, it
                    wasn't really for me, so I decided to give that up and go once again back to my roots, which brings
                    me to where I am now, studying computer programming at St. Clair College.
