                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Christian! You can also call me Chris if you'd like. I am 19 years old and am an
                    aspiring web developer. I am currently studying at St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario, and am set
                    to graduate in 2026. feel free to wander around my website for as long as you'd like and learn more
                    about me.

                <h2>What Matters Most</h1>
                <p>
                    Everyone's life is driven by something. It's what allows them to get up in the morning, it's what gives 
                    them hope when they feel like giving up, and it's what gives them their identity. To some, this 
                    motivator might be money, to others, success, for others, it may be fame, and to others, it might be 
                    love or approval. For me, however, I choose not to identify with any of these, rather, my life is simply 
                    lived for Christ. Money can fade, success can turn into failure overnight, fame in practicality can, in 
                    many ways, be worse than it is better, and love can be lost in the blink of an eye. While not all of 
                    these things are bad to desire, and some are in fact, designed by God, the most solid foundation one can 
                    choose to base their life on is Christ himself and so that is what my life is built upon.

                <h2>Coding Background</h1>
                <p>
                    My coding background goes way back. My first experience with code was at the age of 13 years old, that's 
                    when I first picked up web development after a family friend suggested I give it a try since it seemed 
                    like a path that intrigued me. His hunch ended up paying off, and it turned out that I really enjoyed it, 
                    however, I didn't really stick with it too much after the first year as life got busy, but one day in 
                    grade 10, I got a new opportunity to pursue coding again, and I ended up taking both an Introduction to 
                    Programming class which taught the basics of Python programming and an Intro to Computer Science class. I 
                    then went on to take many more programming classes throughout high school and even dabbled a bit in 
                    robotics.

                <h2>Tough Decisions</h1>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of grade 12, I received word that a robotics company was looking for some apprentices to 
                    work and learn with them. Since it seemed like a great opportunity with great money and even free schooling, 
                    I ended up taking the opportunity and apprenticing as a Machinist/millwright. Long story short, it wasn't 
                    really for me, so I decided to give that up and go once again back to my roots, which brings me to where I 
                    am now, studying computer programming at St. Clair College.
