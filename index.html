                            A fun game developed by three students for a Java II course. The 
                            game integrates the world of driving and music together. Everyone loves 
                            listening to music while driving, so we realized, why not make a game 
                            where the sole objective is to relax, collect currency, and use said 
                            currency to purchase more songs and manage a song library with playlists 
                            that can be listened to while driving? By harnessing the power of JavaFX 
                            and OOP, we were able to make this idea become a reality.

                            This is my passion project. It is not currently available as it is still in 
                            development and will continue to be in development for a while, but once 
                            complete, the objective of the app is to provide Christians with an app that 
                            allows them to access the word of God and plenty of tools and resources 
                            relating to God's word to help them progress further in their relationship 
                            with God and become more skilled in the word of God. A beta for both apps will 
                            eventually be released but it is still far away.
