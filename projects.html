                        A visually stunning website designed to demonstrate my web development 
                        skills while also simultaneously providing more information about 
                        myself and my professional career. While still currently in 
                        development, once complete, you will be able to browse through 
                        three different portfolios, learn about me and my story, and check 
                        out my blog posts.

                        A fun game developed by three students for a Java II course. The 
                        game integrates the world of driving and music together. Everyone loves 
                        listening to music while driving, so we realized, why not make a game 
                        where the sole objective is to relax, collect currency, and use said 
                        currency to purchase more songs and manage a song library with playlists 
                        that can be listened to while driving? By harnessing the power of JavaFX 
                        and OOP, we were able to make this idea become a reality.

                            This is my passion project. It is not currently available as it is still in 
                            development and will continue to be in development for a while, but once 
                            complete, the objective of the app is to provide Christians with an app that 
                            allows them to access the word of God and plenty of tools and resources 
                            relating to God's word to help them progress further in their relationship 
                            with God and become more skilled in the word of God. A beta for both apps will 
                            eventually be released but it is still far away.
